## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted the chosen picture to be featured on the front page as the basis for selecting the color theme for the website. To accomplish this, I utilized the [Adobe Colors - Extract Theme](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) tool.

- I have maintained consistency throughout the website by following the same color scheme, ensuring a pleasant user experience. The colors used were:
  - #023859 for the background color of the body.
  - #f2e4dc for the text color on the body and footer, as well as for the background color of the header (logo and navigation menu).
  - #0d0d0d for the text color of the header (logo and navigation menu) and footer.

### Typography

Google Fonts were utilized to import the selected fonts for use on the website.

- [DM Serif Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Display?query=dm+serif) was used for the headings for being a good contrasting font to be used in combination with [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=Raleway), which was chosen for the rest of the text content due to its sleek and modern design, as well as its excellent readability.
 - For the headings, Verdana was chosen as a browser-safe font, while Arial was used for the body text. Sans-serif was designated as the fallback font for both.

DM Serif Display example:

### Imagery

Since the website serves as an advertisement for an accommodation located at Pepe Beach, I aimed for a photo specifically showcasing this area of Rio. This decision was made deliberately to accurately represent the accommodation's location and to highlight the unique atmosphere offered by Pepe Beach, distinct from the internationally renowned Copacabana and Ipanema beaches.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were initially created for both mobile and desktop versions using Balsamiq. However, during the website development process adjustments were made resulting in alterations to the layout and the number of pages. As a result, the wireframes do not perfectly match the final product, but they served as a foundational guide throughout the development process.

## Desktop wireframes:

## Testing

Please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for details on all testing conducted.

## Fixed bugs
During the test phase a few bugs were detected and corrected accordingly:
1. The logo and the logo text initially didn't align nicely. After attempting various approaches, the issue was resolved by utilizing position: relative; and defining the distance to the bottom using bottom: 16px; for the logo's text.
2. The nav toggle showed the same misalignment and the same approach was used to fix it.
3. The mountain on the homepage's image would be cropped on very large screens (1600px) and didn't look as good. To address this issue, a media query was implemented specifically for very large screens, adjusting the height of the image to ensure optimal display.
4. The background color of the containers in the reasons section, the containers grouping the photos on the accommodation page, the container of the form on the contact page and the one enclosing the message on the "thank you" page, didn't offer enough contrast, making the text difficult to read. To address this issue, the transparency was reduced, creating more contrast while still maintaining a visually pleasing appearance on the pages.
5. The embedded Google Maps did not cover the width of the page. The solution to this issue was to apply a CSS rule to the iframe element, setting its width to 100%.
6. The photos on the accommodation page did not display nicely on larger screens. To address this issue, the order of the room's photos was adjusted using the CSS "order" property.
7. During the Mid-Point Project Review call with my mentor, it was noted that the contact us form could be submitted with an empty space in the First Name and Last Name fields, despite the "required" property being present in the input elements. After researching online for a solution, the following solution was found on the  [Stackoverflow website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13766015/is-it-possible-to-configure-a-required-field-to-ignore-white-space) and the following attributes were added to the input elements: `required pattern=".*\S+.*" title="This field is required"`.
8. The navigation menu was not nicely aligned when the site was visited using the Mozilla Firefox browser.

![Nav menu problem](documentation/nav-menu-firefox-problem.png)

To resolve this issue, a new CSS rule was applied to the nav-menu selector, `align-self: flex-end;`:

![Nav menu problem](documentation/nav-menu-firefox-fixed.png)

## Unfixed Bugs

1. The solution implemented for problem 7 cannot be applied to the "textarea" element, allowing the form to be submitted without a message. As of now, no solution has been found using HTML alone. It's likely that additional programming, such as JavaScript, would be necessary to address this issue.


## Credits

### Code Used

- During the development of the website, I utilized code snippets from the "Love Running" and "Coders Coffeehouse" projects provided in the Code Institute Modules.

- I used the CSS Tutorial from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) in order to better understand the CSS language.

- I learned how to optimize photos for web use by following [this You Tube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfACnNIw2qA&t=613s).

### Content

The documentation in the README file was inspired by both the sample README files provided by Code Institute and the README files authored by Kera Cudmore for the thoroughness and clarity.

Text revisions were made with the assistance from ChatGPT.

### Media

- [Main page background image](https://www.pikist.com/free-photo-ssjyk/download). The photograph on the pikist website was mirrored, and I corrected the mirroring in order to have an accurate image of the beach as it actually is.
