Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I utilised the console in the developer tools to work through small sections of JavaScript and ensure that the code was working, and also to troubleshoot where issues were.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools & Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* [index.html](testing/w3/w3-index.png) - Passed.
* [game.html](testing/w3/w3-game.png) - No errors, 1 Warning. The warning is for an empty H2 tag. This is where the question is inserted using jQuery.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Desktop Results

All pages of the site are achieving a score of 100 across the 4 categories.

### Mobile Results

Each page is achieving a score of 100 for the last three categories. The performance category is achieving a score of 98 for the first three pages and a score of 99 on the 404 & 500 page.

## MANUAL TESTING

### Testing User Stories

`First Time Visitors`

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to take part in a pub quiz online and improve my general knowledge. I want to be able to play at any time, anywhere. | The Quiz Arms pulls general knowledge quiz questions from a large variety of topics, much like a pub quiz would do. The site is available for use whenever is convenient to the user. |
| I want the site to be responsive to my device. | I have developed the site with responsiveness in mind. |
| I want the site to be easy to navigate. | Buttons are used throughout the site for navigation, much like a mobile app. As the site is like a mobile app - I decided that I didn't want to add a navigation bar or footer, as these would make the site look more like a traditional webpage. The page title also acts as a link to the home page.  |

`Returning Visitors`

|  Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to be able to choose a level of difficulty that I feel is appropriate for me, based on my experience from my first visit to the site. | Users are able to select their own level of difficulty before the game begins. Once they have played they are free to select a different level of difficulty for subsequent games. |

`Frequent Visitors`

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to be able to adjust the difficulty level to keep improving my knowledge. | Users are able to select their own level of difficulty before the game begins. Once they have played they are free to select a different level of difficulty for subsequent games. |

### Full Testing

Full testing was performed on the following devices:

* Laptop:
  * Macbook Pro 2021 14 inch screen
* Mobile Devices:
  * iPhone 13 pro.
  * iPhone 11 pro.
  * Phone X.

Each device tested the site using the following browsers:

* Safari
* Firefox

Additional testing was taken by friends and family on a variety of devices and screen sizes. They reported no issues when playing.

One tester in peer code review stated that the bottom of the play screen was cut off when testing on an iphone SE (2nd gen). I was unable to replicate this issue using google chrome developer tools.
