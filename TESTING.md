### Full Testing

Full testing was performed on the following devices:

- Laptop:
  - Macbook Air 13 inch screen
- Mobile Devices:
  - iPhone 13 pro.
  - iPhone 11 pro.
  - Phone X.

Each device tested the site using the following browsers:

Additional testing was taken by friends and family on a variety of devices and screen sizes. They reported no issues when playing.

One tester in peer code review stated that the bottom of the play screen was cut off when testing on an iphone SE (2nd gen). I was unable to replicate this issue using google chrome developer tools.
